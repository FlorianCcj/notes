Methodology - Suck in programming
#################################

Lack of curiosity
*****************

If you lack curiosity about computers and how technology works, you will never be successful as a programmer.

Lack of autonomy and resourcefulness
************************************

If you don’t develop the ability to solve problems for yourself, you will never be successful as a programmer.

Lack of persistence in the face of a problem
********************************************

If you give up easily in the face of problems, you will never be successful as a programmer.

No feeling of success in overcoming a problem
*********************************************

If you don’t feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment after solving a problem, you will never be successful as a programmer.

Impatient about learning and understanding
******************************************

If you are impatient about learning and expect to master everything quickly and effortlessly, you will never truly be successful at programming.

Getting bored/tired from thinking
*********************************

If you are lazy in your thinking and see concentrated, focused thinking as a chore, you will never truly be successful at programming.

Inability to think for yourself
*******************************

If you expect others to think for you, and are unwilling to look at the details of your own situation, you will never be a truly successful programmer.

Rigid, narrow and/or disorganized thinking
******************************************

If you are rigid in your thinking, and you have difficulty keeping your code organized — and by extension your thoughts organized and focused, you will never be successful at programming.

Needing the “right” answer instead of recognizing a spectrum of “good” and “bad” answers
****************************************************************************************

If you see the end goal of programming as finding the right solution, rather than a spectrum of solutions, you will never truly be successful as a programmer.

Not paying careful attention to details
***************************************

If you gloss over details, and overlook little things, you will never be a truly successful programmer.
