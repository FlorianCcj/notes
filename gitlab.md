hi everyone
I am looking for a way to block a `git push` if it doesn t respect some condition do someone have any idea ?
detail : we works with python notebook one my client data ... but we need to don t push on gitlab client data, so in the file we need to check that the output attribut is empty ... if it is not empty we need to stop the push, the data musn t be present in the gitlab
